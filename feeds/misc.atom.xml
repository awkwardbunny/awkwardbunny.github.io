I had a blog from my high school days, but I've been meaning to re-start the blog for a while now.
I'm finishing up my last semester at &lt;a href="https://cooper.edu"&gt;Cooper&lt;/a&gt; and working at &lt;a href="https://www.redballoonsecurity.com"&gt;Red Balloon Security&lt;/a&gt; while I do.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have some ideas for blog posts, mostly some of the projects I've recently done or been working on.&lt;br&gt;
For my senior project at school, I am building a PCIe card with an FPGA on it that users and upload different bitstreams on it to.. do different things...
We call it &lt;a href="https://github.com/RASAC-dev"&gt;RASAC&lt;/a&gt;, Reconfigurable Application Specific Accelerator Card.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another project (that I have recently finished), is the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ME-IRL/BUUL_firmware"&gt;BUUL&lt;/a&gt; (Brian's JUUL). It is supposed to be a JUUL clone.
I've also built an Alexa controlled power outlet, just because, even though you can just buy them on Amazon...
I also have interests on rocketry, so hopefully there'll be posts on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess that's for now&lt;br&gt;
