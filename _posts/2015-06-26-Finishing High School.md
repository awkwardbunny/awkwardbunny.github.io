&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is the last day for me to go to my school. I, along with rest of the Bronx High School of Science Class of 2015, graduated two days ago (June 24, 2015), at the United Palace Theater. Bill Nye spoke for our commencemnt speech. After a few hours of speech and clapping, we all went outside and crowded up the streets and took many pictures and everything.  
Oh, I think I had a pretty cool cap decoration, check it out [here](http://imgur.com/a/2IZ3J).
Today, I go and pick up my diploma as well as my report card. It'll probably be the last time I'll see most of the people there.

Meh.

Anyways, I was waiting for my school bus and found that they come an hour later than usual. Bummer. I still got another 30 minutes until then.
Hmmm...

Well there is another album on my imgur right now, I was thinking maybe I could write about that, but it pretty much have all the decription on it. [Link](http://imgur.com/a/LvqYD)  
So that happened during the Physics C AP exam...  
I think I have another album I could upload to imgur. It was a simple cheap USB flash drive 'hack.' Maybe check that out later...?

I still have 20 minutes to kill...  
OH, here's my selfie I took on stage during graduation:

Uhhh... okay. Goodbye :)
