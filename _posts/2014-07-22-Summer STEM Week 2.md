title: "Summer STEM Week 2"

So I guess it was a bit of a reach for me to write a post every day...  
Here's week 2:  
Earlier in the week (Tuesday), I finished wiring up the adders. I used 2 4-bit adders to make a single 8-bit adders. Looking around the lab, I found the 74181, a 4-bit ALU of 7400 series chips. My partner, Matthew, wanted to wire it up and play around with it a little, so he was working on that. (See pictures below) The boards with much nicer wiring are mine.

Before I moved on to building the rest of the ALU, I thought I would re-design it using logisim. So currently, I'm looking up more stuff and doing some more research.

Earlier this week, 2 of my cousins had come from Korea. They are both older than I am, 27 and 22, and are female. They take turns staying at my house and our uncle's house. I had to show them around the city and all, so we all went out Thursday night to Times Square. That was the second time going out to the city that day. On Saturday, we had a barbeque with them and some other friends and their families.  
On Sunday, we went to the beach. On our way there we stopped by our uncle's house, where I met this bunny :)
