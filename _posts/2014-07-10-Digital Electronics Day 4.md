title: "Digital Electronics Day 4"
---
Today, in the morning, we had to go to a writing seminar, where we sit and listen to a presentation on writing a research paper and all that fun stuff. That was two hours. After that, we went out for lunch. I had curry. It was nice.  
When we came back, the professor and the TA's gave an assignment for us to do in groups of 3. They said whoever finished first with the most efficient circuit would get a prize. My teammates are Lewis and Serena and we later named out team, 'DIP Switch.' Because <del>we're dipsh*ts... No, it's because</del> we turn things on. HA.

So the assignment was to use k-maps and least amount of gates we can to implement braille code. Output braille code on to our 4 LED's, depending on the four binary inputs which would resemble a binary number. We were only given 0-9 to output, and the rest (10-15) didn't matter. It wasn't actually braille; they called it that, but it only had 4 outputs and I'm guessing random combinations of outputs. I'll upload the pictures later, when I get have them.

First, we used the k-maps, for each output, to get the logics (logical?) expressions, then we tried to simplify them. We then wired the gates. Simple, right?
We started off neatly, and trying to keep it that way, until about halfway through, we were all like, "F*$! THIS" and went on messily. We had 3 of the 4 outputs working, but the fourth one needed debugging. It was then that we decided to head back to our homes. yup. That's the end of that day.
