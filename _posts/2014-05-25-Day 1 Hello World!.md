So, FINALLY! I got around to set up this blog I was meaning to since a while ago.
So, again, hello!
This paragraph is going to be a brief 'about me.' My name is Brian and I, at the time of writing, am a junior in high school. I live in New York City and attend Bronx High School of Science.
Today, in fact, is my birthday! WHOOOO! My family and some friends of mine are on a vacation for the memorial weekend. I'm currently sitting in Denny's, waiting for my Grand Slamwich to be served. We're in the poconos somewhere (I forgot the city).
I hope to put up different projects I'm working on abd update this blog as often as I can :) Anyways, my slamwich just came out so I gotta go enjoy it :D Have a nice day..? (Not sure how I should end a blog post)
P.s. the slamwich was easily the best sandwich I've ever had
