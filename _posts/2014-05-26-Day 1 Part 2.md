I just got home about an hour ago and turns out as I was reading, I realized that I forgot to mention a couple of things that I meant to. (wow that sentence had almost too many personal pronouns. oops Ms.McGuigan)

 * If you thought this blog was about food and eating, sorry to disappoint, it's not. I'm a huge food enthusiast. I just like eating very much.
 * I am a 17-year-old Korean-American. My family and I immigrated here when I was 9. I have a younger brother of 2 years behind.
 * I am a programmer and maker. I spend time coding and building stuff when I have the time. Â I also build electronics and hardware hacks sometimes. For the curious, I have plentiful of experience with Java, C, C++, PHP, and Assembly (YES, that's right, ASSEMBLY). I'm currently working on a project with a few close colleagues of mine on building an OS from scratch.

 * And oh yeah, I'm a redditor
