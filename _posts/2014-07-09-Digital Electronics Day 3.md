Had some more practice with binary arithmetic and simplification. Then had a lecture on Karnaugh Map (also known as K-Map). It's used to simplify binary/boolean expressions.
Then continued to work on CPU. Added up to 4 pins, so I can now add up to 15+15. Also built the clock circuit with variable frequency based on 555 timer.

And also, I present you the pictures I took around the lab.
