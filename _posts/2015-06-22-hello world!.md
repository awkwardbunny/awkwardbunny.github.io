&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings! I have finally gotten around to fixing my site as well as this blog. Here, I am going to be writing/posting about things I do, build, find interesting, etc.  
Currently, I am a graduating senior at the Bronx HS of Science. This coming fall, I will be attending [The Cooper Union](cooper.edu) in the city.  
Some of my favorite hobbies include coding, eating, watching videos on YouTube, building electronics, and rest of all the nerdy stuff.

I'm also going to import all the old posts from the previous blog I had. It was running wordpress.  

This whole website is built with [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) as you can see in the footer down there as well. These posts are written in markdown, so I will be testing some stuff:  
[GitHub's markdown basics](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)  
[Jekyll's posts doc](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)

#Testing out markdown stuff
	System.out.println("fHkjsdahfka");

Inline code like `sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root /` can be written by enclosing the code between two single backticks (the thingy above tab).  
{% highlight ruby %}
def foo
    puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}

* Things this list needs:
	* Bulletpoints
	* Nested lists
		* Like this one
	* Link to a [random xkcd comic](https://c.xkcd.com/random/comic/)

##More Headers!
Lorem Ipsum... I don't remember the rest
