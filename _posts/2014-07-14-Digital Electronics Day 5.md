I try to write something everyday, except the weekends.  
I was trying to think of something else two write about this morning, when I had the career seminar for two hours. The guy just talked about colleges and admissions process. Couldn't think of anything, so I started doodling.
Oh yeah and the assignment from last week with the 'braille' circuit. I swear it wasn't working when I left. I sat down and took out an LED while thinking,'What the hell is this doing here?!' I tried the circuit to see what the problem... and guess what? It was working perfectly. It felt like black magic. Actually, felt more like MiracleSort that I read about last week.

There was <a title="Sorting Algorithms Worse than Bogosort" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2609857/are-there-any-worse-sorting-algorithms-than-bogosort-a-k-a-monkey-sort" target="_blank">this</a> thread on stackoverflow about sorting algorithms WORSE than bogosort. Let's say you have a deck of cards. Bogosort shuffles the cards, and sees if the cards are in order. If it isn't it will shuffle again and repeat until it is sorted. Not very efficient, is it?  

Well, one of the comments (the second comment) talked about Miracle Sort that he made up. Using the same deck of cards analogy, miracle sort checks if the cards are in order. If it is NOT in order, it will wait a while, then check again- clearly, a miracle has to happen here.
Yeah, anyways, our (Team DIP Switch) circuit JUST WORKED, we don't know how I fixed it to work, but it worked. As for the ALU...  
Over the weekend (yesterday), I decided I didn't like how my ALU that I was working on was organized, and so I re-wired it. Twice. And then I come into the lab and finish the 'braille' circuit. I didn't have anything to do, so I looked around the cabinets. ANDDD... what do you know; There exists 4-bit full adder IC chips.... (btw it's 4008)

....

I immediately pulled out the wires from the breadboards and started with the adder chips. The whole adder chip would make things much easier. Here's the new layout.
