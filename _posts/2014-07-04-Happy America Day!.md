Happy Birthday America!
I took American History class this year and I DO know my history.
I do know that the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776 and where was it signed? AT THE BOTTOM- hehe (that's a joke)
I know I haven't posted anything in a month (actually, longer than a month), it's a hard habit to get used to... So since then, some things changed. Uhh... one of which is school. School ended for me on the 16th of June, and I had to take some regents exams. So for the last two weeks, I haven't done much but sit around and watch movies, which is pretty fun. Also, starting on Monday, July 7th, I will be attending a summer program (Summer STEM Program @ Cooper Union). I'm looking forward to being useful again.

So Independence Day celebrates the birth of one of the greatest countries in the world.
And to celebrate it, my family, along with some others, went on a trip to... actually, I have no idea where we've been. (I'm gonna ask my mom) ..we went on a trip to Pennsylvania. In the Poconos area. On Friday, we visited Penn's Cave. All the tourists were given a tour on the boat, because it's an all-water cavern. It was really cold inside, but at one point, there were pretty lights. My brother called it the 'RaveCave' because of the funky lights, but my friends and I soon realized how bad that would've sounded (rave cave -&gt; rape cave). We came out of the cave through the back, which was connected to a small pond, and then went back inside towards the entrance. The attached pictures below were taken as we were going back into the cave. I'm not a good photographer, but I thought the lights and colors on the grass looked really nice.

After the cave tour, we all went to our hotel rooms and just sat around for another while. We ate, then around 9PM, we went down to the swimming pool and played in the water. I heard lots of fireworks and stuff, but I couldn't see any from where we were :(
Later that night, some of us gathered and watched a 'horror movie.' Somebody chose "You're Next." If you ever have some extra time on your hands, don't bother watching it. It is just a very terrible movie. I went back to my room and watched some episodes of Family Guy, Futurama, and the Simpsons and fell asleep.

So the morning came on July 5th, and I woke up.
I went down stairs, and had a nice American breakfast in the hotel.
Nice sausages with bacon and scrambled eggs. The waffles and pancakes that just fills you up nice and good.
The plan for the day was to go to the Bushkill Falls. So we did. The whole thing was more like a mild hike. The mountain had a couple of trails which, in between, had places where you could view different waterfalls. I took another picture that I thought looked alright. It's currently my desktop background and I just wanted to share it here. It will be the third picture. After we came back down, we had dinner together and went our ways towards home. That was the end of the trip.
