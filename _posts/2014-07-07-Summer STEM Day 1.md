title: "Summer STEM @ Cooper Union: Day 1"
---
Today, as I mentioned once before, I started the summer program at CU. I woke up and saw the note I left to myself the night before. It read, "GET ON LIRR BY 8:46." And I did. I have to take the LIRR from Bayside to Penn Station then the N or the R to 8th St./NYU. When I got off at the station, I was wildly confused. There were MANY people and also MANY exits and entrances. After stumbling through the station I decided to pick an exit and got out. Eventually, I got there. Everyone in the program gathered in the Great Hall. The instructor in the front gave some basic info but I was on reddit...

Later, we were introduced to our TA's and our professor. I was enrolled in Digital Electronics class, which I already had some experience with. We were then taken up to the lab, and WOAH. It was perfect.
They had everything that you would ever need in an electronics lab. The desks were set up nicely, with multimeters, power supply and oscillioscopes on the shelf above, computer on the side, and a clean surface for students to work on. Around the lab were many drawers that contained ALL basic electronic components. (resistors, caps, connectors, transistors, IC's of all kinds, etc) I was amazed.
What we did in the lab and class will be on a separate post.

After the program ends, at 3:30, we are allowed to stay a bit after, to work on projects or whatever. I headed back towards home around 4PM. I stumbled through the busy streets and Penn Station once again. Got on the train and fell asleep. I woke up to the hole puncher sound and saw a lady standing near me. I quickly pulled out my ticket and showed it to her. Apparently, I got on the wrong train and had to pay a $3 fine. The LIRR is very confusing for me. So that was my day of confusion and excitement.

Edit: We also took pictures for our ID Cards. I'll post a picture when I get mine
