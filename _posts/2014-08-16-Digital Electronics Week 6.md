title: "Digital Electronics Week 6"
---
So this week was the final week of the 6 week program. I was quite sad as the end approached. On Thursday, we gave our presentations on our project that we worked on. So I'll add a last update on our project.  
Othello. We ended up doing the game logics on the arduino and building only the display drivers and the inputs using the chips. The display worked partially. I'm not quite sure what was wrong. Upon careful analysis, I came to a conclusion that our project was haunted. I was testing each parts of the RAM input/output circuit, and if I remember it correctly, the buffers that handled output from the memory output data, even when there was no data in. Maybe it's storing the data in the surrounding air particles or something. Future 'cloud' technology?

Still, the presentation went along fine. It would've been great if it actually worked.
I don't know, maybe I'll finish it and get it working.  
As for the whole program in general, it was a great and an awesome experience to work on such project with other people and the professor (and the TA's. I didn't forget my cool TA's: Jen, Ahuva, and Abi. and Chris?). Although I previously had much knowledge on the subject, I still learned and experienced many things. And lastly, it was all very much fun. I would again like to thank the Cooper Union ... uhh... people for having me at the program to be part of a wonderful experience, and Professor Risbud and the previously mentioned people.

Here's the final picture of the project:

And I'll upload the group photo we took. I don't have them yet :/
