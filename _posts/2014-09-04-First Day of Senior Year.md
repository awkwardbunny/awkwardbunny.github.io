title: "First Day of Senior Year"
---
Today was D-Day, the day we NYC students go back to school. It has finally come upon us.Â Honestly, I have no idea what I was expecting, but today went along pretty well.  
Last couple of weeks, after my summer program at Cooper Union ended, I've been sleeping and sitting around and stuff. I volunteered at a library near my house.  

Oh, also, I've been doing more reading on software exploits. Read some great tutorials <a title="Corelan Exploit Tutorial" href="https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/07/19/exploit-writing-tutorial-part-1-stack-based-overflows/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="Greyhat Stack Buffer Overflow" href="https://greyhat.gatech.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Stack_Buffer_Overflow" target="_blank">here</a>. More fun stuff.

Yesterday, I got some superglue so that I could wind some coil for a small coilgun. I would need to get a larger spool of wire, but made a small coil yesterday. It came out pretty nice for a first try.

For actual power, I'm thinking of using 22-gauge, and I'll probably need around 6 or 7 layers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;So yeah, I am a senior, but it doesn't feel any different. yet.  
I got my program/schedule and was pretty satisfied. Saw all my teachers, and they all seemed pretty cool and relaxed about things. So the day went along. I guess taking many classes last 3 years did help since I now have lots of free periods that I don't have any class during.
I also started a journal kind of thing, where I keep a small notebook on me and just jot down stuff as the day goes by. I'm hoping it would also help me remember what happened that day when I'm writing this blog.
I came home today and took a 3 hour nap. Feels pretty good. It was unfortunate that I got some homework on the first day, but they weren't too hard.
