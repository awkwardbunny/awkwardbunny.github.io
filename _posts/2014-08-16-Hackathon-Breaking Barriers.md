---
Tomorrow, or today, Saturday, August 16th, I will be attending a hackathon in Manhattan. It is hosted by... some people. I don't know who. But this will be my first hackathon. Yup. I am excited to see what it would be like. Some of my friends, like <a title="William Woodruff" href="http://woodruffw.us/" target="_blank">Will</a> and <a title="Harsh Baid" href="http://harshbaid.com/" target="_blank">Harsh</a>, will be attending as well.  
It's called <a title="Breaking Barriers Hackathon" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/breaking-barriers-hackathon-tickets-12534722693" target="_blank">Breaking Barriers Hackathon</a>. Information in the eventbrite link.
I don't know what we'll be doing/building/hacking yet.

More updates to come.

They just sent us an email telling us a secret just for those who check  their emails in the mornings. Ha. I guess I beat the system.

The whole hackathon was just great and pure awesomeness. I took the LIRR then walked to the place. I met up with Will and later with Harsh. We were supposed to brainstorm, but couldn't really come up with much. Instead, we decided to just work on our personal projects separately. Harsh was coding something for his client using js node, and Will and I worked on Will's <a title="ET" href="https://github.com/woodruffw/et" target="_blank">ET bot</a>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ET is a simple IRC based command-and-control server. When the program is run, it will discreetly 'phone home' (E.T reference) to Will's IRC server, from where he can then authorize himself to the target computer and send any commands to it. We were working on it when one of the hosts asked us to just demonstrate it later, along with the others. We did it. The presentation/demo was kinda awkward it being completely out of nowhere and improvised as we went along. I had my computer connected to the projector and ran the et.exe. Will, using his laptop, then sent messages and commands to my computer, such as calculator.exe, explorer, and the most annoying of all, iexplore.  
Other than that, all the people there were all cool. We got free lunch AND dinner. Numerous pies of pizza for lunch and about 200 servings of chinese food for dinner. There were about 110 people at the event. Overall, as my first hackathon, I enjoyed it very much, and definitely go to another one. #BreakingBarriersHack
