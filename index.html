<h1 class="title">Hello!</h1>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently a student at <a>The Bronx High School of Science</a> in New York City, and I study computers and electrical engineering. In the fall, I will be a freshman at <a href="https://cooper.edu">The Cooper Union</a> majoring in Electrical Engineering.<br>
In my free time, I like to browse through reddit and hackaday on the web. <a href="http://hackaday.com">Hackaday</a>, if you don't know, features dozens of interesting projects and articles from the community.
</p><p>
I must say that I am pretty proud of the design of this website as I am a terrible designer/front-end developer.<br>
My favorite programming languages are Java and C/C++, but I can deal with Python. I can build moderate Android apps, and have experience with assembly and sorts. I really like low-level stuff; Low-level, almost-hardware hacks and coding really gets me going.
</p><p>
I still haven't yet figured out what to put on this website...<br>
So...You can go check out my <a href="/blog/">blog</a> or my <a href="https://github.com/awkwardbunny/">GitHub page</a> in the meantime. Lately, I've been working on my project 'BSOS,' which is a hobby operating system being created from scratch. I don't know for how long I'll keep the project going, although it's proving to be pretty fun.
</p><p>OH and if you have an interesting project or whatever to share, shoot me an email about it :)
